# House of Games API

## Background

API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

The API is hosted at the following address [https://houseofgamesbackendapi.herokuapp.com](https://houseofgamesbackendapi.herokuapp.com)

Database used will be PSQL (version 12.12), using node-postgres (version 8.7.3) to interact with it.

## Setting up environment

1. First, fork the repo to your own account
2. Clone the repo on to your local machine with the following line </br>
```
git clone https://github.com/musaab03/backend-api
```
3. Then cd into the directory
4. Create 2 .env files (.env.test & .env.development)
5. In .env.test add the following line 
```
PGDATABASE=nc_games_test
```
6. In .env.development add the following line  
```
PGDATABASE=nc_games
```
7. Excecute the following line to import all the needed modules </br>
```
npm install
```
7. Excecute the following commands to seed the database
```
npm run setup-dbs
```
```
npm run seed
```
   Done!
